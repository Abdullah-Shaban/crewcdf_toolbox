### Known Issues

#### Linux font problems in plots are too small.

Install xfonts packages with the following command. Then logout and login from your session to get the font list updated.

    sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi

#### Use Matlab >2013a

The toolbox uses read functions that only appeared in 2013a version. However, it is possible to get the missing functions from file exchange.
